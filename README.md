# Hey visitors! Welcome to the world of Coder-X15!!

I'm Sam Ruben Abraham, a first year student in B.Tech in Computer Science with Specialisation in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, studying in Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam (IIIT-K). I have been acive in GitHub since my 8th grade and so may contain slightly silly projects besides the ones that are possibly serious, so forgive me if some of my repos seem useless ðŸ˜…. But yeah, sooner I shall be posting really serious projects as time allows, so strap up your seatbelts for an exciting journey ahead! ðŸ˜‰.
